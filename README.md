# DirectX12 Scratch

This is just my attempt to recreate [triangle example of DirectX Graphics Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12HelloWorld/src/HelloTriangle) in Rust.

Contains examples using Microsoft's Windows-Rs bindings and older community driven Winapi bindings.

I might make the example in other languages too.
